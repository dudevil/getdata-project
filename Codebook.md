# The tidy UCI HAR dataset.

The file `tidy_dataset.txt` was generated by the run_analysis.R script (see README for more info on the script) from the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) dataset. Please refer to the above webpage for more information on the original dataset.

The tidy dataset contains 79 average measurements of 30 subjects, who have performed 6 activities.

~~~
Activity:
  Type: character
  Values: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
~~~
~~~
Subject:
  Type: numeric
  Values: 1-30
~~~

The features come from a accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals. The mean and standart deviation of these measurements were provided in the original dataset. The tidy dataset contains values of the measurements averaged by subject and activity type. The Measurement contains 3-ccordinate components XYZ. Means of the signal contain the "mean" word in the variable name, while standart deviations contain "std" keyword.

The features prefixed with the letter `t` correspond to time-domain features, while the features prefixed with the letter `f` were obtained by applying a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to some of these signals (see `features_info.txt` in the original dataset for more information).
